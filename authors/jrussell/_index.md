My passion is automation. I love building processes and writing scripts to save someone time.

Right now I'm a freelancer and a consultant.  I've also worked for various tech startups in the Indianapolis area.

My areas of expertise mainly consist of automation tech like server side scripting and configuration.  I am also a capable developer and system administrator, so I have the ability to diagnose a wide range of issues, maintaining the solutions I develop.
